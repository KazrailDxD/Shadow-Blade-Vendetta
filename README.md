# Shadow-Blade-Vendetta (2021)(Unity)

Shadow Blade Vendetta is a 2D Jump & Run platformer and was my second project with a team. I was responsible for the level system, player attributes, opponentsspawner, collectables, gadgets/traps and sound. Teammates in this project included Younes Rida(enemy AI and player skills), and Patrick Vala(player,graphics,art,ui).
